**Name:** Manaswi Sakharwade 
**PRN:** 24070521169

## Overview
This repository contains the 8051 Assembly Language Programs (ALP) for the Continuous Assessment (CA-1). All programs were simulated using the EdSim51DI simulator.

## Case Studies Included
1. **PRN Generation:** Logically constructing the last four digits of my PRN (1169) using arithmetic instructions.
2. **Restricted Comparison:** Comparing two numbers without using `CJNE`, `DJNZ`, or `SUBB`.
3. **Addressing Modes:** Demonstrating the difference between Direct and Indirect addressing.
4. **Logical Operations:** Constructing the mobile number digits `2243` using bitwise logic.
5. **Memory Compaction:** In-place removal of `FFH` gaps in RAM.

## Tools Used
* EdSim51DI Simulator
* 8051 Instruction Set
